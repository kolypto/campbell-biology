## 7.1. Cellular membranes are fluid mosaics of lipids and proteins
The currently accepted model of the plasma membrane: the **fluid mosaic model**. It is continually being refined.

Membranes are composed of: lipids, proteins, some carbohydrates.

Phospholipids have an ability to form membranes between two aqueous compartments: it is inherent in their molecular structure. They are **amphipathic**: have a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic region.

Most membrane proteins are amphipathic as well: their orientation maximizes contact of hydrophilic regions with water, while providing their hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment.

Proteins are not randomly distributed: they are often grouped in long-lasting, specialized patches, where they carry out common functions.

### The Fluidity of Membranes




## 7.2. Membrane structure results in selective permeability



## 7.3. Passive transport is diffusion of a substance across a membrane with no energy investment



## 7.4. Active transport uses energy to move solutes against their gradients



## 7.5. Bulk transport across the plasma membrane occurs by exocytosis and endocytosis
