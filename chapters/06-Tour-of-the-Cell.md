# Chapter 6. A Tour of the Cell

## 6.1. Biologists use microscopes and biochemistry to study cells

### Microscopy
In a light microscope (LM), visible light is passed through the specimen and then through glass lenses that refract (bend) the light in such a way that the image of the specimen is magnified.

**Light microscopes** can magnify to about 1000 times the actual size of the specimen. It cannot resolve details finer than about 200nm regardless of the magnification. This prevented cell biologists from studying **organelles**: the membrane-enclosed structures within eukaryotic cells.

**Electron microscope** focuses a beam of electrons through the specimen or onto its surface. Resolution is inversely related to the wavelength of the light (or electrons) a microscope uses for imaging, and electron beams have much shorter wavelengths than visible light. Modern electron microscopes can theoretically achieve a resolution of about 0.002nm, though in practice they usually cannot resolve structures smaller than about 2nm across. Still, it's a 100-fold improvement.

**Scanning electron microscope (SEM)** uses an electron beam to scan the surface of the sample, usually coated with a thin film of gold. The beam excites electrons on the surface, and these secondary electrons are detected by a device. The result is an image of the specimen's surface.

**Transmission electron microscope (TEM)** is used to study the internal structure of cells: it aims an electron beam through a very thin section of the specimen, which has been stained with atoms of heavy metals, which attach to certain cellular structures, thus enhancing the electron density there.

Instead of using glass lenses, both SEM and TEM use electromagnets as lenses to bend the paths of the electrons, ultimately focusing the image onto a monitor.

Light microscopes still offer advantages: one can study living cells, whereas with electron microscopy yhe methods used to prepare the specimen kill the cells.

Recent development: new type of TEM called *cryo-electron microscopy* (cryo-EM) allows specimens to be preserved at extremely low temperatures. This avoids the use of preservatives, allowing visualization of structures in their cellular environment.
The Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded in 2017 to the developers of this valuable technique.

### Cell Fractionation
A useful technique is **cell fractionation** which takes cells apart and separates  subcellular structures from one another. A centrifuge is used to break down cells and separate components by size: at higher speeds, smaller components settle to the bottom of the tube as pellets.

This allows to prepare specific cell components in bulk.

## 6.2. Eukaryotic cells have internal membranes that compartmentalize their functions

### Comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells
All cells share certain features. They are all bounded by a selective barrier: the *plasma membrane*. Inside all cells is a semi-fluid, jellylike substance called **cytosol**, in which subcellular components are suspended. All cells have *chromosomes*, which carry genes in the form of DNA. And all cells have *ribosomes*, tiny complexes that make proteins according to instructions from the genes.

A major difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells is the location of their DNA.

In a **eukaryotic cell** (means: "true nucleus"), most of the DNA is in the organelle called *nucleus*, which is bounded by a double membrane.

In a **prokaryotic cell** ("before nucleus"), the DNA is concentrated in a region that is not membrane-enclosed, called the **nucleoid**.

The interior of a cell is called the **cytoplasm**. Eukaryotic cells have membrane-enclosed organelles of specialized form an function; prokaryotic cells do not have organelles. Some prokaryotes, however, have regions surrounded by proteins where specific reactions take place.

Typical eukaryotic cells are 10-100 μm in diameter. Prokaryotic cells are generally much smaller: 1-5μm. The logistics of carrying out cellular metabolism set limits on cell size.

Smallest cells known are mycoplasmas: they have diameters between 0.1-1.0μm. These are perhaps the smallest packages with enough DNA to program metabolism and enough enzymes and other cellular equipment to carry out the activities necessary for a cell to sustain itself and reproduce.

### Plasma Membrane

The plasma membrane is a bilayer of phospholipids with various proteins attached to or embedded into it. Carbohydrate side chains may be attached to proteins or lipids on the outer surface.

Metabolic requirements inpose a theoretical upper limits on the cell size. The **plasma membrane** is a selective barrier that allows passage of enough oxygen, nutrients, and wastes to service the entire cell. For each square micrometer of membrane, only a limited amount of a particular substance can cross per second, so the ratio of surface area to volume is critical. As a cell increases in size, its surface area grows slower than its volume.

The need for a surface area large enough to accommodate the volume helps explain the microscopic size of most cells.

Cells that exchange a lot of material, such as intertestinal cells, may have long thin projections, called *microvilli*, which increase surface area.

In addition to the plasma membrane, a eukaryotic cell has extensive, elaborately arranged internal membranes that divide the cell into compartments: the organelles. The compartments provide different local environments that support specific metabolic functions, so incompatible processes can occur simultaneously in a single cell.

All membranes participate directly in the cell's metabolism because many enzymes are built right into the membranes. Each type of membrane has a unique composition, suited to its specific functions.

For example, enzymes embedded into the membranes of mitochondria function in cellular respiration.
