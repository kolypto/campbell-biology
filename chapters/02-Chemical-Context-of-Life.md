# Chapter 2. The Chemical Context of Life

Wood ants live in colonies. When threatened from above, the ants shoot volleys of formic acid into the air from their abdomens, and the acid bombards the potential predator, such as a hungry bird.

## 2.1. Matter consists of chemical elements in pure form and in combinations called compounds.

### Elements and Compounds
**Matter**: anything that takes up space and has mass.

**Element**: a substance that cannot be broken down to other substances by chemical reactions.

**Compound** is a substance consisting of two or more different elements.

Example: pure sodium is a metal, and pure chlorine is a poisonous gas. When chemically combined, however, NaCl is edible.

Example: water H₂O consists of two gases: H and O in a 2:1 ratio.

These are simplest examples of organized matter having emergent properties: a compound has characteristics different from those of its elements.

### The Elements of Life
Just 4 elements make up approximately 96% of living matter: O, C, H, N.
The following elements account for most of the remaining 4%: Ca, P, K, S.

**Trace elements** are required by an organism in only minute quantities. Example: humans need only 0.15mg of iodine (I).

## 2.2. An element's properties depend on the structure of its atoms
**Atom**: the smallest unit of matter that still retains the properties of an element.

Atoms are so small that it would take about a million of them to stretch across the period printed at the end of this sentence.

Atoms are made of protons, neutrons, electrons. **Protons** give the nucleus a positive charge. **Electrons** form a "cloud" of negative charge around the nucleus. This interaction keeps them together.

For atoms and subatomic particles, mass is measured in **daltons**. A dalton is the same as the *atomic mass unit*. Neutrons and protons have masses close to 1 dalton. Electrons are only about 1/2000-th that of a neutron, so we can ignore them.

### Atomic Mass and Number
An *electrically neutral atom* would have the number of its protons balanced by the number of electrons.

> <sub>11</sub><sup>23</sup>Na.

`11` is the **atomic number**. `23` is the **mass number**. This means that the atom has `11` protons, `23` particles in the nucleus. That is, it has `23-11 = 12` neutrons.

### Isotopes
**Isotopes**: atoms of an element that have different number of neutrons.

In nature, an element may occur as a mixture of its isotopes. 99% of carbon in nature is carbon-12. That is, <sub>6</sub>¹²C. Most of the remaining 1% of carbon consists of <sub>6</sub>¹³C with an extra neutron.

All carbon isotopes have 6 protons: otherwise, they would not be carbon. They behave identically in chemical reactions.

Both ¹²C and ¹³C are stable isotopes: their nuclei do not have a tendency to lose subatomic particles in a process called decay. ¹⁴C, however, is unstable, or radioactive.

A **radioactive isotope** is one in which the nucleus decays spontaneously, giving off particles and energy. It may lose protons (and transforms into a different element), or it may lose neutrons.

For instance, when ¹⁴C decays, it becomes ¹⁴N.

### Radioactive Tracers
Radioactive isotopes are often used as diagnostic tools.

Cells can use radioactive atoms just as they would use nonradioactive isotopes of the same element. These radioactive isotopes are incorporated into biologically active molecules, which are then used as tracers.

PET (positron-emission tomography) detects locations of intense chemical activity in the body, such as cancer.

### Radiometric dating
**Half-life** of the isotope: the time it takes for 50% of the isotope to decay. It's a fixed rate, unaffected by temperature, pressure, etc.

Half-life values range from very short (seconds) to extremely long (uranium-238: 4.5 billion years). Thus, each isotope can best measure a particular range of years.

Carbon-14 (¹⁴C) decays to ¹⁴N at a constant rate. ¹⁴C is present in the atmosphere in small amounts at a constant ratio with both ¹³C and ¹²C. When a plant is alive, these carbons are incorporated into the plant in the same proportions in which they were present in the atmosphere. The proportions remain the same in the tissues of an animal that eats the plant.

Once an organism dies, it stops taking in new ¹⁴C, and existing ¹⁴C continues to decay, while ¹²C remains the same because it is stable.

Thus, by measuring the ¹⁴C/¹²C ratio, and comparing it to the original ratio in the atmosphere, we can calculate how long the pool of original ¹⁴C has been decaying.

This ratio can be converted to years because we know that half of ¹⁴C decays every 5730 years.

Data: a particular neanderthal fossil had 0.7×10⁻³ as much ¹⁴C as the atmosphere. This means that the fossil is dated `-log₂(0.7×10⁻³) * 5730` = 41 625 years old.

Carbon dating works for fossils up to 75 000 years old. Older fossils contain too little ¹⁴C to be detected.
