# Chapter 5. The Structure and Function of Large Biological Molecules
Given the rich complexity of life on Earth, it might surprise you that the most important large molecules found in all living things can be sorted into just four main classes: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.

Some of them can be so huge that they are called **macromolecules**. For example, a protein may consist of thousands of atoms that form a molecular colossus.

## 5.1. Macromolecules are polymers built from monomers
Large carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids are chain-like molecules called polymers.

A **polymer** (Greek *polys*, many, and *meros*, part) is a long molecule consisting of many similar or identical building blocks linked by covalent bonds. The repeating units are smaller molecules called **monomers**.

### The Synthesis and Breakdown of Polymers
Although each class of polymer is made up of a different type of monomer, the chemical mechanisms by which cells make and break down polymers are basically the same in all cases.

In cells, **enzymes** are specialized macromolecules that speed up chemical reactions.

**Dehydratation reaction** is a reaction in which two molecules are covalently bonded to each other with the loss of a water molecule. It can link two monomers: one with hydroxyl group `­— OH`, another with a hydrogen `— H`.

**Hydrolysis** (Gk. *hydro*, water, *lysis*, break ) is a reaction that disassembles polymers to monomers.

The bulk of organic material in our foods are in the form of polymers that are much too large to enter our cells. Within the digestive tract, various enzymes attack the polymers, speeding up hydrolysis. Released monomers are then absorbed into the bloodstream for distribution to all body cells.



## 5.2. Carbohydrates serve as fuel and bulding material
**Carbohydrates** include sugars and polymers of sugars.

Simplest carbohydrates are the monosaccharides, or simple sugars.

Disaccharides are double sugars: two monosaccharides joined by a covalent bond.

Polysaccharides are composed of many sugar building blocks.

### Sugars
**Monosaccharides** generally have molecular formulas that are some multiple of the unit CH₂O.

The hallmarks of sugars: a carbonyl group `C = O` and multiple hydroxyl groups `— OH`.

Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆), the most common monosaccharide, is of central importance in the chemistry of life.

Depending on the location of the carbonyl group, a sugar is either an aldose (aldehyde sugar) or a ketose (ketone sugar). Glucode is an aldose, fructose is a ketose.

Still another source of diversity is the spacial arrangement of a molecule. Glucose and galactose, for example, differ only in the placement of parts around one assymetric carbon. What seems like a small difference is significant enough to give the two sugars distinctive shapes and binding activities, thus different behaviors.

### Linear and Righ Forms of Glucose
The linear carbon skeleton representation is not completely accurate. In aqueous solutions, glucose molecules, as well as most other 5- and 6-carbon sugars, form rings, because they are the most stable form of these sugars under physiological conditions.

### Mono and Disaccharides

Monosaccharides, particularly glucose, are major nutrients for cells. In the process known as cellular respiration, cells extract energy from glucose molecules by breaking them down in a series of reactions. Their carbon skeletons also serve as raw material for the synthesis of other types of small organic molecules, such as amino acids and fatty acids.

A **disaccharide** consists of two monosaccharides joined by a **glycosidic linkage**: a covanent bond formed between two monosaccharides by a dehydration reaction.

Maltose, known as "malt sugar", is an ingredient used in brewing beer. It's made of glucose + glucose.

Sucrose, or table sugare, is a glucose + fructose.

Lactose, the sugar present in milk, is another disaccharide: glucose joined to a galactose.

Disaccharides must be broken down into monosaccharides to be used for energy by organisms. Lactose intolerance is a common condition in humans who lack lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose. The sugar is instead broken down by interstinal bacteria, causing formation of gas and subsequent cramping. The problem may be avoided by taking the enzyme lactase when eating or drinking dairy products, or consuming dairy products that have already been treated with lactase to break down the lactose.
